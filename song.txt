We have not lost ourselves, we do not need mana
A team of all-bank and zombie magicians
There's a playful bit so on the taverns
The slain captain drowned for bravado here
Acapella unfinished poured sadness
Catch for life che not a fountain

The world of fucking antennas
In an hour of change, the urban will reduce the day
He was not ready to appease this love, he turned gray
I hate myself, but I live every day
Only clouds, yes shadow
He didn't want to know me from the myth
This world has burned down for me, kill
Bury my body, I'm not waiting for change
I was bored with everything
In particular, he gave himself the floor
Don't forget who I live for, but I'm a scumbag and an asshole
And I didn't stop him
I was spinning the day
Music fool me in crowds
So what's the point, I can't die from this
Forget my name, forget me
